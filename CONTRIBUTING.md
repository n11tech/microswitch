4. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   mvn clean test
   ```

5. **Run all quality checks**

### Code Style

We use Google Java Style Guide. The build includes Checkstyle validation that will enforce these standards.

* Use meaningful variable and method names
* Write comprehensive Javadoc for public APIs
* Keep methods small and focused
* Write tests for new functionality
* Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### Testing

* Write unit tests for all new functionality
* Ensure integration tests pass
* Aim for high test coverage (minimum 80%)
* Test edge cases and error conditions

### Documentation

* Update README.md if needed
* Add Javadoc for public APIs
* Update DEPLOYMENT_USAGE.md for new features
* Include examples in documentation

## Development Guidelines

### Architecture

Microswitch follows Clean Architecture principles:

* **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and interfaces
* **Application Layer**: Use cases and application services
* **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns (metrics, configuration)

### Design Patterns Used

* **Strategy Pattern**: For deployment strategies
* **Factory Pattern**: For strategy creation
* **Facade Pattern**: For simplified API
* **Template Method**: For common deployment logic

### Adding New Deployment Strategies

1. Create a new class implementing `DeploymentStrategy`
2. Extend `DeployTemplate` for common functionality
3. Add strategy to `StrategyType` enum
4. Register in `DefaultDeploymentStrategyFactory`
5. Add configuration properties
6. Write comprehensive tests
7. Update documentation

## Release Process

1. Update version in `pom.xml`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create release PR
4. Tag release after merge
5. GitHub Actions will handle deployment
